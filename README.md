# Hello-World

I'm Simone, italian, 27 years old.
I'll start with a fun fact about me: when I was a child I was so obsessed with DragonBall, that I had to look the daily audience number it had on "Italia 1", the tv channel where it was streamed. I always hoped it was on the top! Well, it wasn't very often, as the night tv show was the most viewed. By the way, DragonBall scored quite often in the first 3 positions, competing with the Simpsons and Futurama. 
I looked those numbers on "Televideo",  the teletext service broadcast on the television channels in Italy. 

Well, as you can imagine, I have a passion for data, numbers, rankings and so on. I re-discovered this passion at the university by studying statistics. 

I have a degree and post-degree in communication science, but since I found out data really catch up my attention, I started dig into this field.

I'm enrolled in the Codecademy Data Analysis course and in the Data Science specialization at Barcelona Activa. 

I hope you will follow me and my projects here on GitHub!

Wish you the best!
